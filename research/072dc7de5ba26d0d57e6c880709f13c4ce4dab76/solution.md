          <p>With the advent of deep learning we can use neural networks to our aid.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  We can use neural networks at appropriate position in KLT, possibly right after calculating the gradient of the image so as to extract important features
                  (which then act as a proxy for image gradients in KLT) that can account for the reliablity of the gradient and make the system more robust.
              </li>
              <li>
                  There are techniques already present which make use of the various flavour of neural networks for object tracking, but these techniques are known to
                  fail at instances because they go haywire in unknown environments (the environments which were not present in the training data.)
              </li>
              <li>
                  Our proposed solution aims to capture the best of both worlds making a more reliable and robust object tracking system.
