                <p>With the advent of neural-network based object tracking techniques, geometrical approaches for object tracking have lost their grandeur. Though these neural-network based techniques suffer from an inherent problem of relying too much
                    on training data. These technniques go hay-wire in unknown environments where the geometrical approaches still prevail. This can be attributed to their
                    model agnostic behaviour. In this work we introduce a technique of coalescing these two approaches such that they overcome each other's drawbacks by using
                    deep modelnets with pluggable geometric vision modules. We show that this technique is more versatile and robust then the existing object tracking techniques.
