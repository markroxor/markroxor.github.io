              <p>The general idea of object tracking is followed as - </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>In the first frame, we mark an set of points in which our object lies. These points bound the object we wish to track.</li>
                  <li>In subsequent frames it is expected that we will keep getting a new set of coordinates which will keep bounding the object.</li>
              </ul>
